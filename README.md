# Mochi
Mochi is a simple, open source, blogging platform for you to share your thoughts and ideas. The main differentiator between Mochi and other vanilla blogging platforms is that it has an iOS companion app for writing your content on.

## Motivation

The reason I built Mochi is because I felt the blogging tools available to me were lacking this sort of "in between" where I could easily spin up a full-featured blog, have an iOS native writing experience, and still have full control over how it's deployed and the code.

## Who is Mochi for?

Mochi has been built for a more technical user. It requires a fair amount of technical knowledge to set up â€” if you're browsing GitHub and have some familiarity with the command line, then you'll be able to set up your own blog on with Mochi.

## How does Mochi work?
